This directory contains all of the files for the TicTacToe program. The program
runs by loading up a settings file passed in as a parameter, if it is valid then
the program is then run. The program can run games, display logs, save logs to a
file and view current settings. In editor mode the user can change the settings 
of the game at run time. In secret mode the user cannot save logs to file.

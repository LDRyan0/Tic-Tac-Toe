# Tic-Tac-Toe

Date Created: 19/07/2019

This directory contains all of the files for the TicTacToe program. The program can
be run in the command line without any arguments and will default to 3x3 board. 
The name of a settings file can be attached (see appropriate format) for arbitrary
number of rows, columns and win condition length. The game can be run in a Player 1
vs Player 2 or asPlayer 1 vs Computer.

The program was initially created for my major assignment COMP1000 Unix and C
Programming at Curtin University, however I endeavored to go back and add in a
basic minimax solver to the program and to establish my Git skills.
